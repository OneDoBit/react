# Making simple app to push people to download Adobe Illustartor

Here I'm trying to use techniques that we learned in class and show how i was able to use them in my app. This app must call users to get basically click the button on the buttom and alert pops up. Also I set up so I could change the colors of my svg files realy easy. I would do Images or text instead of simple colors in arrays, but i felt like from design point of view this looks a lot better.

## Installation

1) Fall in Love with React and get your hand on the guide.
2) Install NodeJS
3) Get the command line tool "npm install expo-cli --global"
4) Creat your app "expo init my-new-project"
"cd my-new-project"
"expo start"
5) Scan the QR code
6) Find file where you saved it and start editing App.js
7) Create your components (in  my case SVG file)
8) Pass your values in a component through props (just to make your app.js more clear and easier to reference)
9) Create Arrays and loop through as many as you have
10) Finally create a button and create a function that will be called once the button is pressed

## Usage

Open the app, and enjoy how I made downloading Illustartor easier.
Experience is much better from phone, because svg file looks different on phone and website.
